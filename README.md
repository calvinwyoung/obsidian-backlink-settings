# Backlink Settings Plugin

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that allows users to save preferred
settings for the backlinks / "Linked mentions" pane at the bottom of notes.

By default, Obsidian doesn't retain backlink settings so users need to adjust them each
time they open a new file.

This plugin allows users to save default values for the following options:

- "Sort order": The default sort order
- "Collapse results": Whether to collapse backlink results
- "Show more context": Whether to show more context with backlink results

These values get applied to the backlinks pane each time a file is opened.

<!-- ## Installation

The plugin is available in the official [Community Plugins repository](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=backlink-settings). -->

## Usage

1. Open Obsidian Settings
2. Navigate to the "Backlink Settings" tab
3. Configure preferred settings
